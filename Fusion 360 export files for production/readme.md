In this folder there are several files. All these files are exported from Fusion 360 to produce the final prototype. I sent all these files to [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com) and a week later I had at home the final product.
It was incredible to see this happening. 

PCBWay created my PCBs, the 3D printing for the main body and the cover (sheet metal fabrication). The only thing that was not really affordable is the 3D printing.
The price was 280 dollars + shipping cost + customs. The main body should have been a sheet metal prototype as well.  

The cost of the cover that holds the 18 footswitches was 100 dollars (if I order 1 or 3). I ended up ordering 3.  

The cost of the PCBs was very cheap.

#### So the files are:
- ***Cuerpo.stl*** : It is the file of the mainbody to order the 3D print. (exported from Fusion 360)
- ***Placa Pedales V2 horizontal.step*** : It is the file to order the sheet metal with the holes for the leds, footswtiches and LCD. (exported from Fusion 360)
- ***Placa Pedales Drawing.jpg*** : picture I added with the dimensions to order the sheet metal.
- ***Footswtich board - 3 v14_2021-04-13.zip*** : File to order the PCB for the switches. (exported from Fusion 360). You can order directly [here](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Footswtich_PCB_for_my_pedalino_mini_prototype.html)
- ***Mainboard_sch_36_revised v18_2021-04-15.zip*** : File to order the mainboard PCB that host the ESP32. (exported from Fusion 360). You can order direclty [here](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Pedalino_mini_mainboard.html)


Besides the key components presented in the Pedalino Mini project. I wanted to share some of the prototype :

The [lens](https://www.tme.eu/fr/details/fix-lc5-3/lentilles/fix-fasten/) are small plastic inserts for the finish of the cover.  
You need extra [M12](https://www.ebay.fr/itm/233320916727?hash=item365302a6f7:g:1WQAAOSwXepcTurq) to hold the PCB to the footswitches.  
The [leds](https://www.banggood.com/fr/10Pcs-One-Bit-WS2812B-Serial-5050-Full-Color-LED-Sensor-Module-p-964189.html?rmmds=detail-left-hotproducts&cur_warehouse=CN). It would be ideal to just by the leds and capacitor without the extra PCB and pins but I couldn't really solder that.  
These are are some of the components I used in the rear pannel:
- [Switch1](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1349203593.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.46d66c37LY1Li4).  
- [Switch2](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1346271859.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.39186c37tSKdOL).  
- [USBconnector](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1346271859.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.46d66c37LY1Li4).  
- [Vin](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/32974835401.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.46d66c37LY1Li4).  
- 6,5mm jacks are standard.  
- These are the [footswitches SPDT](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/32873378875.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.46d66c37LY1Li4).  
- I wouldn't recommend the calbles I used but [these ones](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/32954418743.html) recommended by @Miqviq.  
- [Inserts](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B08K1BVGN9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for the bolts.
