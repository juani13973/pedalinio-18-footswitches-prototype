In this folder there are 3 files that I exported from Fusion 360. I do not know if they can be imported into your fusion 360 app really. But I also have public links for my project.

***Pedalino Mini 2 v23.f3z*** is the main project that has several components:
1. Main body
2. The cover that will hold the 18 switches and the LCD
3. The Mainboard
4. 6 PCB to host 3 footswtiched per PCB. (Since I am using the freeversion of Fusion 360, I was limited in the size of the PCB. I could not host 6 SPDT switches). Those PCBs also have the leds.
5. Finally 18 lens for the leds.

***Mainboard v21.f3z*** is the mainboard PCB where the ESP32 is hosted.

The PCB export is also shared at PCBway. You can order directly the PCBs : https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Pedalino_mini_mainboard.html


***Footswitch board - 3 v11.f3z*** is the PCB to host 3 SPDT switched and 3 leds. With 2 of these PCBs you can create a ladder for 6 footswitched connected by cables.

These are screenshoots of Fusion 360 to give you un idea of the construction:

Same view without the sheet metal cover where the 18 footswitches, 18 lends and LCS are hosted.

The design of the PCB that host the footswitches and help to build the ladder. You need 2 to build the line of 6 footswitches.
