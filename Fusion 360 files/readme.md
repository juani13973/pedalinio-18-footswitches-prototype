In this folder there are 3 files that I exported from Fusion 360. I do not know if they can be imported into your fusion 360 app really. But I also have public links for my project.

***Pedalino Mini 2 v23.f3z*** is the main project that has several components:
1. Main body
2. The cover that will hold the 18 switches and the LCD
3. The Mainboard
4. 6 PCB to host 3 footswtiched per PCB. (Since I am using the freeversion of Fusion 360, I was limited in the size of the PCB. I could not host 6 SPDT switches). Those PCBs also have the leds.
5. Finally 18 lens for the leds.

The PCB export is also shared at PCBway. You can order directly the PCBs : https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Pedalino_mini_mainboard.html


***Footswitch board - 3 v11.f3z*** is the PCB to host 3 SPDT switched and 3 leds. With 2 of these PCBs you can create a ladder for 6 footswitched connected by cables.
